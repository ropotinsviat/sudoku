          <p>We do not disclose your information to external third parties.</p>

            However, within the context of gameplay, other participants in the

          <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
          <p>
            We retain gameplay data and generated identifiers as long as

            required by law. You may request that we delete your data at any
            time by contacting us through our support channels.

          </p>

          <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
          <p>
            Since our Site does not store personal identifying information, we
            do not support specific account management features. However, you
            may manage cookies on your browser to control or remove your user
            token, which will reset your Site profile (generated name and
            picture).
          </p>
